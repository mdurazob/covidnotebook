2020,cross-reactivity,Huibin Lv,Cross-reactive antibody response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections,"Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. ",0
2018,Low level SARS-CoV Z-1,F Luo,Evaluation of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of SARS-CoV Infection in Rhesus Macaques Immunized with an Inactivated SARS-CoV Vaccine,The results suggested that the inactivated vaccine was safe and the immunized rhesus macaques could be used as the model for testing ADE of the candidate vaccine.,2
2016,Tamiflu & M2,McKimm Breschkin,Meeting report: 4th ISIRV antiviral group conference: Novel antiviral therapies for influenza and other respiratory viruses,"With the emerging development of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics, the potential implications of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease were also addressed. Topics covered all aspects from structural and molecular biology to preclinical and clinical studies.",34
2016, S597-603,Wang Q,Immunodominant SARS Coronavirus Epitopes in Humans Elicited both Enhancing and Neutralizing Effects on Infection in Non-human Primates,"Thus, peptide-based vaccines against SARS-CoV could be engineered to avoid ADE via elimination of the S597-603 epitope. We provide herein an alternative strategy to prepare a safe and effective vaccine for ADE of viral infection by identifying and eliminating epitope sequence-dependent enhancement of viral infection.",10
2014,Monoclonal antibodies,SF Wang,Antibody-dependent SARS coronavirus infection is mediated by antibodies against spike proteins,"Results from infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by diluted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins. We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection. Combined, our results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins may trigger ADE effects.",37
2014,FcyRII,Yip MS,Antibody-dependent infection of human macrophages by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,These results demonstrate that human macrophages can be infected by SARS-CoV as a result of IgG-mediated ADE and indicate that this infection route requires signaling pathways activated downstream of binding to Fc?RII receptors.,23
2012,IFITM Protein,YK Chan,IFITM Proteins Restrict Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Virus Infection,We observed that IFITM proteins restricted ADE-mediated and direct infection with comparable efficiencies in a myelogenous leukemia cell line. Our data suggest that IFITM proteins can contribute to control of secondary DENV infections.,42
2011,Raji B cell,MS Yip,Investigation of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of SARS coronavirus infection and its role in pathogenesis of SARS,"The occurrence of antibody-mediated infection of human Raji B cells was further investigated by using live SARS-CoV. Similarly to results obtained with the SARS-CoVpp, only anti-SARS-CoV Spike serum, but not mock immune-serum, induced a massive increase of SARS-CoV viral genes (ORF1b and Nucleocapsid) and viral proteins (Membrane and Nucleocapsid) in Raji B cells.",1
2011,FcyRII,M Jaume,Anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Spike Antibodies Trigger Infection of Human Immune Cells via a pH- and Cysteine Protease-Independent Fc?R Pathway,"Antibody-mediated infection was dependent on Fc? receptor II but did not use the endosomal/lysosomal pathway utilized by angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the accepted receptor for SARS-CoV. This suggests that ADE of SARS-CoV utilizes a novel cell entry mechanism into immune cells. ",36
2007,TNF-alpha,T Takano,"TNF-alpha, produced by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)-infected macrophages, upregulates expression of type II FIPV receptor feline aminopeptidase N in feline macrophages","The pathogenicity of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is known to depend on macrophage tropism, and this macrophage infection is enhanced by mediation via anti-S antibody (antibody-dependent enhancement, ADE). In this study, we found that TNF-alpha production was increased with viral replication in macrophages inoculated with a mixture of FIPV and anti-S antibody, and demonstrated that this culture supernatant had feline PBMC apoptosis-inducing activity",52
2007,triSpike S Protein trimer,YW Kam,Antibodies against trimeric S glycoprotein protect hamsters against SARS-CoV challenge despite their capacity to mediate Fc?RII-dependent entry into B cells in vitro,We investigated whether a recombinant native full-length S-protein trimer (triSpike) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was able to elicit a neutralizing and protective immune response in animals and analyzed the capacity of anti-S antibodies to mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus entry in vitro and enhancement of replication in vivo. ,58
1992,Monoclonal antibodies,Corapi VW,Monoclonal antibody analysis of neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement of feline infectious peritonitis virus.,"In most instances, neutralizing MAbs were able to induce ADE, demonstrating a direct relationship between neutralization and enhancement. The difference in immunoglobulin subclass between neutralizing MAbs that induced ADE and those that did not induce ADE suggests that there may be a restriction in the immunoglobulin subclasses capable of mediating ADE.",114
1991,M Protein,H Vennema,Primary structure of the membrane and nucleocapsid protein genes of feline infectious peritonitis virus and immunogenicity of recombinant vaccinia viruses in kittens,"Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) causes a mostly fatal, immunologically mediated disease in cats. Previously, we demonstrated that immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the FIPV spike protein (S) induced early death after challenge with FIPV (Vennema et al., 1990, J. Virol. 64, 1407-1409). In this paper we describe similar immunizations with the FIPV membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the amino acid sequences with the corresponding sequences of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus revealed 84.7 and 77% identity for M and N, respectively. Vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the cloned genes induced antibodies in immunized kittens. Immunization with neither recombinant induced early death after challenge with FIPV, strongly suggesting that antibody-dependent enhancement is mediated by antibodies against S only. Immunization with the N protein recombinant had no apparent effect on the outcome of challenge. However, three of eight kittens immunized with the M protein recombinant survived the challenge, as compared to one of eight kittens of the control group.",83

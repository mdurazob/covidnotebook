2008,critical care capacity,Rubinson L,"Definitive Care for the Critically Ill During a Disaster: A Framework for Optimizing Critical Care Surge Capacity From a Task Force for Mass Critical Care Summit Meeting, January 26–27, 2007, Chicago, IL"," Shifting critical care disaster preparedness efforts to augment limited, essential critical care (emergency mass critical care [EMCC]), rather than to marginally increase unrestricted, individual-focused critical care may provide many additional people with access to life-sustaining interventions. ",99
2010,component-based,Jacco Wallinga,Optimizing infectious disease interventions during an emerging epidemic," Here we present first principles for allocating scarce resources with limited data. We show that under a broad class of assumptions, the simple rule of targeting intervention measures at the group with the highest risk of infection per individual will achieve the largest reduction in the transmission potential of a novel infection. ",123
2011,Dynamic prediction,A Uribe,Predictive and Reactive Distribution of Vaccines and Antivirals during Cross-Regional Pandemic Outbreaks,"We develop a large-scale simulation-driven optimization model for generating dynamic predictive distribution of vaccines and antivirals over a network of regional pandemic outbreaks. The model incorporates measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the cost of lost productivity and medical expenses. ",0
2011,surveillance economics,Barbara Hasler,Conceptualising the technical relationship of animal disease surveillance to intervention and mitigation as a basis for economic analysis,"Surveillance and intervention are resource-using activities of strategies to mitigate the unwanted effects of disease. Resources are scarce, and allocating them to disease mitigation instead of other uses necessarily involves the loss of alternative sources of benefit to people.",0
2012,optimal vaccine coverage,Elodie Adida,Operational issues and network effects in vaccine markets," Although vaccines provide the most effective means for preventing infectious diseases, there are two main reasons why it is often difficult to reach a socially optimal level of vaccine coverage: (i) the emergence of operational issues (such as yield uncertainty) on the supply side, and (ii) the existence of negative network effects on the consumption side. ",33
2012,stochastic modelling,Adam Kleczkowski,Searching for the most cost-effective strategy for controlling epidemics spreading on regular and small-world networks," The choice of the optimal strategy is governed mainly by a relative cost of palliative and preventive treatments. If the disease spreads within the well-defined neighbourhood, the local strategy is optimal unless the cost of a single vaccine is much higher than the cost associated with hospitalization. In the latter case, it is most cost-effective to refrain from prevention. ",35
2013,public policy,JW Timbie,Systematic Review of Strategies to Manage and Allocate Scarce Resources during Mass Casualty Events,We analyzed published evidence on strategies to optimize the management and allocation of scarce resources across a wide range of MCE contexts and study designs.,68
2016,dynamic resource allocation,Reza Yaesoubi,Identifying Cost-Effective Dynamic Policies to Control Epidemics,"We describe a mathematical decision model for identifying dynamic health policies for controlling epidemics. These dynamic policies aim to select the best current intervention based on accumulating epidemic data and the availability of resources at each decision point. We propose an algorithm to approximate dynamic policies that optimize the population’s net health benefit, a performance measure which accounts for both health and monetary outcomes. ",6
2017,Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle,Luca Bolzoni,Time-optimal control strategies in SIR epidemic models,"Applying the Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP) to the unconstrained control problems (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), we prove that, for all the policies investigated, only bang–bang controls with at most one switch are admitted.",8
2018,linear regression,Dimitrious Gouglas,Estimating the cost of vaccine development against epidemic infectious diseases: a cost minimisation study,"We used a linear regression model to identify drivers of development costs from preclinical through to end of phase 2a. Drawing from published estimates of vaccine research and development probabilities of success, we simulated costs for advancing these 224 vaccine candidates through to the end of phase 2a. We combined these findings to determine minimum costs for progressing at least one vaccine through to the end of phase 2a per epidemic infectious disease by means of a stochastic optimisation model.",20
2019,Point-of-care testing,Kost GJ,"Geospatial Science and Point-of-Care Testing: Creating Solutions for Population Access, Emergencies, Outbreaks, and Disasters",POCT-enabled spatial grids can map sentinel cases and establish geographic limits of epidemics for ring vaccination.,0
2019,Accumulated Error,KV Parag,Optimising Renewal Models for Real-Time Epidemic Prediction and Estimation,"The effective reproduction number, Rt, is an important prognostic for infectious disease epidemics. Significant changes in Rt can forewarn about new transmissions or predict the efficacy of interventions. The renewal model infers Rt from incidence data and has been applied to Ebola virus disease and pandemic influenza outbreaks, among others.",0
2020,bayesian smoothing,Sarah McCough,"Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing: A flexible, generalizable model for real-time epidemic tracking","Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. ",0
2020,State-transition-matrix,Ke Wu Sr,Utilize State Transition Matrix Model to Predict the Novel Corona Virus Infection Peak and Patient Distribution,"We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days.",0
2020,exponential growth,Q Q Song,Study on assessing early epidemiological parameters of coronavirus disease epidemic in China,"Considering the epidemic is ongoing, the exponential growth model was used to fit the incidence data of COVID-19 from 10 to 31 January, 2020, and exponential growth method, maximum likelihood method and SEIR model were used to estimate the basic reproduction number. Results: Early COVID-19 cases kept an increase in exponential growth manner before 26 January, 2020, then the increase trend became slower. ",0

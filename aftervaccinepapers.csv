2019,V920,Monath TP,rVSV?G-ZEBOV-GP (also designated V920) recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with Ebola Zaire Glycoprotein: Standardized template with key considerations for a risk/benefit assessment,"During the first few days after vaccination, many vaccinees experience a mild acute-phase reaction with fever, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia of short duration; this period is associated with a low-level viremia, activation of anti-viral genes, and increased levels of chemokines and cytokines. Oligoarthritis and rash appearing in the second week occur at a low incidence, and are typically mild-moderate in severity and self-limited.",9
2018,MVvac2-MERS-S(H) ,BS Bodmer,Live-attenuated bivalent measles virus-derived vaccines targeting Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus induce robust and multifunctional T cell responses against both viruses in an appropriate mouse model,"MVvac2-MERS-S(H) induces robust humoral and cellular immunity against MERS-S mediating protection. Here, the induction and nature of immunity after vaccination with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or novel MVvac2-MERS-N were further characterized. We focused on the necessity for vector replication and the nature of induced T cells, since functional CD8+ T cells contribute importantly to clearance of MERS-CoV. ",8
2018,alum+CpG,Y Deng,Enhanced protection in mice induced by immunization with inactivated whole viruses compare to spike protein of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"No antigen-specific T-cell immunity was detected after vaccination based on the interferon-? ELISpot assay. Mice were transduced with Ad5-hDPP4 after the final immunization and were then challenged with MERS-CoV (1?×?105 plaque-forming units). Compared with the control group (adjuvant alone), mice immunized with the S protein or IV showed slightly lower pathological damage in the lung, as well as reduced antigen expression and lung virus titers. ",6
2020,MVA–NiV-G,Georgia Kalodimou,A Soluble Version of Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G Delivered by Vaccinia Virus MVA Activates Specific CD8 and CD4 T Cells in Mice,Overlapping peptides covering the entire NiV-G protein were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR?/?) mice after vaccination with the MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines,0
2018,T cell response,Roberts LM,Temporal requirement for pulmonary resident and circulating T cells during virulent Francisella tularensis infection,"Despite the dominant in vivo response by parenchymal CD4+ T cells after vaccination and challenge, circulating CD4+ T cells were superior at controlling intracellular Ftt replication in vitro. Further examination in vivo revealed temporal requirements for resident and circulating T cells during Ftt infection.",1
2017,T cell response,Allison Chirstiansen,CD11a and CD49d enhance the detection of antigen-specific T cells following human vaccination,"A phase I vaccine trial enabled us to evaluate a novel gating strategy based on surface expression of CD11a and CD49d as a means of detecting antigen-specific, cytokine producing CD4 and CD8 T cells induced after vaccination of naïve individuals against leishmaniasis.",5
2012,T cell response,Shih-Min Wang,The regulatory T cells in anti-influenza antibody response post influenza vaccination,"The plasma level of the transforming growth factor (TGF-?), but not interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-?, TNF-?, was also found to increase significantly after vaccination.",25
2019,rAd5-S,Ozharovskaia TA,Immunogenicity of Different Forms of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome S Glycoprotein,The most significant cellular immune response was induced after vaccination of the animals with the full-length S (rAd5-S). These investigations suggest that the full-length S and the membrane form of the RBD (RBD-G) are the most promising vaccine candidates among all the studied forms of S glycoprotein.,1
2018,Ad5-hDPP4 ,Deng Y,Enhanced protection in mice induced by immunization with inactivated whole viruses compare to spike protein of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus,No antigen-specific T-cell immunity was detected after vaccination based on the interferon-? ELISpot assay. Mice were transduced with Ad5-hDPP4 after the final immunization and were then challenged with MERS-CoV (1?×?105 plaque-forming units).,6
2018,T cell response,Veit S,CD8+ T Cells Responding to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein Delivered by Vaccinia Virus MVA in Mice.,"Antibodies directed against the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein are thought to play a major role in controlling MERS-CoV infection and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity. In contrast, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of MERS-CoV that are recognized by CD8+ T cells.",7

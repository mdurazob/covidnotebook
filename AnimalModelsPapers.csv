1990,Mice,Daniel C,"Protection from lethal coronavirus infection by affinity-purified spike glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus, strain A59",Murine hepatitis viruses provide excellent animal models for the study of virus-induced diseases of the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Several studies have indirectly provided evidence that the spike glycoprotein (S) of these coronaviruses bears determinants for pathogenesis and the induction of protective immunity.,44
2005,Murinae,Zhi Y,Identification of murine CD8 T cell epitopes in codon-optimized SARS-associated coronavirus spike protein,"The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new type of coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). CD8 T cells play an important role in controlling diseases caused by other coronaviruses and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity in corresponding animal models. ",43
2005,Immunological,Roberts A,"Animal models and antibody assays for evaluating candidate SARS vaccines: Summary of a technical meeting 25–26 August 2005, London, UK","Administration's ""animal rule"" would apply to licensure of a SARS vaccine, it is important to develop standardized animal models and immunological assays in preparation for this eventuality. ",15
2007,Mice,Du L,Receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV spike protein induces long-term protective immunity in an animal model,"In this study, BALB/c mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 10microg of RBD-Fc (RBD fused with human IgG1 Fc) and boosted twice at 3-week intervals and one more time at 12th month. Humoral immune responses of vaccinated mice were investigated for up to 12 months at a 1-month interval and the neutralizing titers of produced antibodies were reported at months 0, 3, 6 and 12 post-vaccination. ",62
2007,F344 Rats,J Virol,Participation of both Host and Virus Factors in Induction of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in F344 Rats Infected with SARS Coronavirus," By contrast, adult rats infected with the passaged virus showed respiratory symptoms and severe pathological lesions in the lung. Levels of inflammatory cytokines in sera and lung tissues were significantly higher in adult F344 rats than in young rats. During in vivo passage of SARS-CoV, a single amino acid substitution was introduced within the binding domain of the viral spike protein recognizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is known as a SARS-CoV receptor.

2007,Mice,Barry Rockx,Synthetic Reconstruction of Zoonotic and Early Human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Isolates That Produce Fatal Disease in Aged Mice,"Using synthetic biology and reverse genetics, we describe the construction of a panel of isogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains bearing variant spike glycoproteins that are representative of zoonotic strains found in palm civets and raccoon dogs, as well as isolates spanning the early, middle, and late phases of the SARS-CoV epidemic",57
2013,Multiple,D Safronetz,Animal models for highly pathogenic emerging viruses, For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral pathogens.,23
2014,Mice,Agnihothram S,A Mouse Model for Betacoronavirus Subgroup 2c Using a Bat Coronavirus Strain HKU5 Variant,"We use this platform to (i) identify a broad-spectrum antiviral that can potentially inhibit viruses closely related to MERS-CoV, (ii) demonstrate the absence of increased eosinophilic immune pathology for MERS-CoV N protein-based vaccines, and (iii) mouse adapt this virus to identify viral genetic determinants of cross-species transmission and virulence. This study holds significance as a strategy to control newly emerging viruses.",31
2015,Ferret,DY Oh,A Novel Video Tracking Method to Evaluate the Effect of Influenza Infection and Antiviral Treatment on Ferret Activity,"Ferrets are the preferred animal model to assess influenza virus infection, virulence and transmission as they display similar clinical symptoms and pathogenesis to those of humans.",18
2015,Cross-Mouse,LE Gralinski,Genome Wide Identification of SARS-CoV Susceptibility Loci Using the Collaborative Cross,"Using genetically diverse animals from incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross mouse panel, we demonstrate a greatly expanded range of phenotypes relative to classical mouse models of SARS-CoV infection including lung pathology, weight loss and viral titer. ",69
2017,Ferret,Layton DS,Development of an anti-ferret CD4 monoclonal antibody for the characterisation of ferret T lymphocytes,"The ferret is an established animal model for a number of human respiratory viral infections, such as influenza virus and more recently, Ebola virus. However, a paucity of immunological reagents has hampered the study of cellular immune responses. Here we describe the development and characterisation of a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the ferret CD4 antigen and the characterisation of ferret CD4 T lymphocytes.",3
2019,Mice,Sarah R Leist,Increasing the translation of mouse models of MERS coronavirus pathogenesis through kinetic hematological analysis," We recently generated a mouse model for MERS-CoV pathogenesis through the humanization of the orthologous entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). To increase the translatability of this model, we validated and established the use of an automated veterinary hematology analyzer (VetScan HM5) at biosafety level 3 for analysis of peripheral blood. ",2
